# Automated-Moisture-Level-Control-in-Water-Treatment-Plant-Control-Panels
The purpose of this project is to reduce the moisture content in control panels of water treatment plants which could lead to rusting of the components in the panels while also maintaining optimal temperature for the functioning and extended lifetime of theelectronic components found in the control panels. When moisture content in the panel increases, the system heats up air and runs it through the panel to reduce the content to a more acceptable level.
